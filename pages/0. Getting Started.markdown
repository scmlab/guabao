<small>(This is a work-in-progress. A more complete, step-by-step tutorial shall be presented here.)</small>

## Installation

To install Guabao you must have [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can install Guabao by searching for the extension "Guabao" in the editor, or through the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scmlab.guabao).
A one-click installation downloads the frontend as well as pre-compiled backend.

## Activation

Once the extension is installed, activate Guabao by creating a new file and saving it with extension `.gcl` (for Guarded Command Language).

Copying and pasting the code below to the pane in the left, you should see a screen similar to this:

![](../images/screenshot-v0.2.3.jpg)

```
con A, B : Int { A ≥ 0 ∧ B ≥ 0 }
con even, odd : Int -> Bool
var r, a, b : Int

{: INV = a * b + r = A * B ∧ 0 ≤ b :}
a, b, r := A, B, 0
{ INV, bnd: b }
do b ≠ 0 ->
    if even b -> a := a * 2
                 b := b / 2
     | odd b ->  ?
                 b := b - 1
    fi
od
{ r = A * B }
```

## The Interface

* The program is in the left pane.
  * A yellow wavy line indicates "there are verification conditions incurred here." Move the cursor there to see the details.
* The right pane contains information including
  * inferred verification conditions (only those on the path of the current location of the cursor are displayed),
  * pre and postconditions of *specs* (holes missing code),
  * global properties, etc.
* Click on a defined identifier (e.g. `INV`) to expand it.
* Each verification condition comes with a hash key. Pressing the hash key generates a comment in the program text, where a proof about the property is supposed to be given.

## Key Combinations

* `ctrl-c-r`: when the cursor is in a hole, pressing `ctrl-c-r` fills in the hole.
* A question mark `?` generates a new hole.
* The language uses UTF-8 characters in some occassions. Press `\` to input UTF-8 characters used in this language.

## The Programming Language
